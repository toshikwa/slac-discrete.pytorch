# SLAC for discrete action settings in PyTorch
A PyTorch implementation of Stochastic Latent Actor-Critic(SLAC)[[1]](#references) extended for discrete action settings. I tried to make it easy for readers to understand the algorithm. Please let me know if you have any questions. Also, any pull requests are welcomed.

## Requirements
You can install dependenxies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
